## 📊 Dataset

It uses the [California Housing dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices), which has the following features.

1. longitude: A measure of how far west a house is; a higher value is farther west
2. latitude: A measure of how far north a house is; a higher value is farther north
3. housingMedianAge: Median age of a house within a block; a lower number is a newer building
4. totalRooms: Total number of rooms within a block
5. totalBedrooms: Total number of bedrooms within a block
6. population: Total number of people residing within a block
7. households: Total number of households, a group of people residing within a home unit, for a block
8. medianIncome: Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars)
9. medianHouseValue: Median house value for households within a block (measured in US Dollars)
10. oceanProximity: Location of the house w.r.t ocean/sea
